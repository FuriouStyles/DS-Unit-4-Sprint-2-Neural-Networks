Defining Neural Networks \n","\n","Write *your own* definitions for the following terms:\n","\n","- **Neuron:**\n","A Neuron, or node, is an individual computational unit in a layer inside a neural network. It takes as inputs one or more values from the previous layer (if it's a hidden or output layer) multiplied by a weight. The output of the neuron is the sum of those weighted inputs passed through an activation function like Sigmoid, Softmax, or Relu.\n","\n","- **Input Layer:**\n","The input layer is the first layer of neurons that takes external data as inputs. There is no activation for these neurons. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the number of features in the dataset. \n","\n","- **Hidden Layer:**\n","Hidden layers are where the magic of Neural Networks takes place. Hidden layers are made up of Neurons, the number of which is predetermined before training begins. These hidden neurons take the inputs from previous layers and outputs that activated weighted sum to the next layer. Hidden layers aren't directly accessible during the training process. The only way we can affect these layers and the neurons inside them is by tuning the weights during backpropagation, and by defining their characteristics during compilation.\n","\n","- **Output Layer:**\n","The output layer is our target. It is the thing we are trying to predict. For regression problems, there is typically only one neuron in the output layer. For classification problems, the number of neurons represents the number of different classes in the target and the values in those neurons represents a probability the that node/class is the predicted class.\n","\n","- **Activation Function:**\n","The activation function is the function that each neuron passes its inputed weighted sum to. The purpose of an activation function is three fold. First, you want to reduce the importance of any one feature by reducing the value of the weighted sum to a number between 1 and 0. Second, it reduces computational load in the same manner, as doing matrix multiplication between matrices with huge values can quickly become computationally expensive. Finally, it reduces linarity in the model to help the model generalize better."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HehpDPIrCHL5","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Explain how back propagation works as if you were explaining it to a five year-old.

Say you wanted to throw a perfect strike in baseball but you didn't even know how to throw a baseball! The things that make a good strike in baseball might not be easy to know. For example, the way you hold the baseball, how you stand, the motion that your arm and body makes, and how hard you throw it all have an impact on the outcome of your pitch. Back propagation is the process of seeing how good or bad your pitch is, and then making adjustments to your form to make your pitch better.\n","\n","Say you throw a 100 pitches super hard but quickly discover you fall over every time. You're off balance, so the first thing to change is how you stand before the pitch. That is your first back propagation adjustment! After 100 more pitches you see you're throwing it all over the place because you're gripping the ball with your whole palm. The next adjustment is to change your grip.\n","\n","After 10,000 pitches, the adjustments that you have make eventually get smaller and smaller. This is called **loss**, and once this loss reaches a certain point you should be regularly throwing perfect strikes!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hqmtKnOuCHMC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Remember our Simple Perceptron Class from Monday.

The number of neurons in the input layer should be the same as the number of features, minus your target feature, in your data set. In the case of a simple perceptron you have no hidden layers, so the next layer is your output layer. The output layer should have one neuron for regression problems. In the case of a classification problem, the number of neurons in the output layer should be equal to the number of classes in the target feature. Next, you intialize the weights to a random number. These numbers should be too big so as not to make your matrix multiplication to strenuous. Consider number similar to the number of input and output nodes. Finally, you implement the activation function that is applied to the output layer. For now we'll just say it's a sigmoid function.\n","- **Feed-Forward:** Once the architecture is built the next thing to do is feed the training data through the network. After this process you're left with an error value, which simplistically represents the difference between your network's output and the expected output.\n","- **Back Propagation:** This error value is then passed into a derivative of the activation function, which in this case is the sigmoid derivative. This derivative function makes changes to the weights according to the error.\n","- **Train Some More:** You repeat this feed-forward -> back propagation process, called an epoch, multiple times until the output of the loss function no longer changes with great significance. At this point your weights are ideally calibrated to make a prediction!\n","- **Test:** The last step is to push a hold out test set with known outputs through your network one time, with no back propagation, to determine the accuracy of the network. The metrics that are available are many, but let's just assume it's the mean absolute error.\n","- **Predict:** If the model's accuracy is acceptable, you can now pass in any data of the same dimensions to make a prediction using the feed-forward step! \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"inUXn4lLCHMJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<a id=\"Q2\"></a>\n","## 2.
